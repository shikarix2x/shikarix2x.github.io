My GitHub account showcases various open source contributions and personal projects, with a focus on collaborative coding and software development. It serves as a platform to track my progress, share code, and engage with the developer community. I created a repository that hosts a simple Python & lua application for automating daily tasks. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and a detailed README explaining how to install and use the tool. To clone the repository, first go to the repository page on GitHub. Then, click the "Code" button and copy the link under the HTTPS section. Open your terminal or command prompt and type git clone followed by the link you copied. Press enter, and Git will download the repository to your local machine. Finally, navigate to the folder where the repository was cloned by using the cd command with the repositoryâ€™s name.
